  <div class="hello">
    Welcome to my personal website! 
    <br> About me:
    I dedicated most of my time in high school studying Art, Design and History,
    and was accepted into a Fine Art Illustration Major at an early age.
    <br> I decided the Art Industry wasn't for me, deadlines and commercial viability are the antithesis to artistry.
    <br> What interested me is how software provided uncalculable wealth for artists. 
    Limitless paper, unlimited clay, silkscreens, etc. 
    New tools would arrive for specific use cases, and everyone would celebrate on online forums, sharing their configurations.
    <br> I want to program like an artist, studying and learning from the tools I was given,
    and contributing meaningfully to the future.
